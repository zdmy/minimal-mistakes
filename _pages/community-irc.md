ZDMY technologies tread our community with respect and friendly. 
We has an official IRC channel, #zdmy, on the [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) network. Please take a few moments to review the rules and guidelines below before joining the channel.


##ZDMY IRC Rules and Guidelines

We try to remain as informal as possible but there are some rules and we’d appreciate if you would follow them! Broadly, if you’re friendly, tolerant, and reasonable, you’ll probably go a long way without any specific knowledge of the rules – but for to avoid any doubt and prevent any misunderstandings, here they are.


##How to Treat Other Users

In order to make the channel a pleasant place for all of our users, we expect all to remain as friendly and tolerant as possible. We request that you refrain from profanity and that you show respect to the other channel members and visitors. If you find that you’re becoming frustrated with the channel or other users, we encourage you to take a moment to do something else. Try to ensure you don’t make people feel like you’re just taking advantage of them – help others out while you’re waiting for a reply to your questions, and say thanks!


##How to Argue

As mentioned above, we’d appreciate it if you’d strive to be friendly and tolerant. We also encourage debates and in-depth discussions about topical subjects. If you choose to participate in one, we expect you to remain as reasonable as possible and employ the skills of logic and critical thinking. These skills will serve you well in discussion, enable you to communicate more efficiently, and spot when others are being less than forthcoming with the truth!

##Language

Our IRC channel is an both English & Chinese speaking channel. There are no other official channels in any other language.

We are a family-friendly IRC channel and will not tolerate foul language. Save it for the playground.
